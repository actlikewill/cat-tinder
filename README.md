# Cat Tinder
### Its tinder for cats.

- The app is deployed here: [https://meownder.herokuapp.com](https://meownder.herokuapp.com)

### Notes
---
- The main page shows a new cat profile when loaded.
- Clicking next loads the next profile.
- Clicking on the thumbs up likes that image which you can see when you click on the 'My Likes link'.
- A random sub_id is generated for the user which is used to uniquely match you to your liked images. It is saved in local storage so clearing you browser data will reset your liked images.
- There is no a backend or proxy server so the API key is not very well secured!
- The app uses Redux for state management.
- There is a lot that can be done to improve the application, eg. the app does not distinguish between likes and dislikes, there is no favorites functionality, better ui, etc
- Thanks and enjoy!
